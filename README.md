Color Palette Generator

This application lets users create their own custom color palettes and save them locally for later use. There are two generators in the app at the moment; one that randomly generates colors (hit or miss) and another that generates color harmonies based on a primary color. The latter is still in development but is usable if you want to grab the hex codes for your colors.

There is still a lot of work, features and fine tuning to be done.

Also, there are a few palettes included in the repo at the moment.

Enjoy!
